# Cornell-Holland Ab-initio Materials Package
{: .fs-7 .mb-4 .mr-2}

The Cornell-Holland Ab-initio Materials Package (CHAMP) is a quantum Monte Carlo suite of programs for electronic structure calculations of atomic and molecular systems. The code is a sister code of the homonymous program originally developed by Cyrus Umrigar
and Claudia Filippi of which it retains the accelerated Metropolis method and the efficient
diffusion Monte Carlo algorithms.

The European branch of the code is currently developed by Claudia Filippi and Saverio Moroni,
with significant contributions by Claudio Amovilli and other collaborators.

CHAMP has three basic capabilities:

* Metropolis or variational Monte Carlo (VMC)
* Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC)
* Optimization of many-body wave functions by energy minimization (VMC) for ground and excited states

Noteworthy features of CHAMP are:

* Efficient wave function optimization also in a state-average fashion for multiple states of the same symmetry (VMC)
* Efficient computation of analytical interatomic forces (VMC)
* Compact formulation for a fast evaluation of multi-determinant expansions and their derivatives (VMC and DMC)
* Multiscale VMC and DMC calculations in classical point charges (MM), polarizable continuum model (PCM), and polarizable force fields (MMpol)




{: .warning }
> This website documents the features of the current `main` branch of the Just the Docs theme. See [the CHANGELOG]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link CHANGELOG.md %}) for a list of releases, new features, and bug fixes.

Just the Docs is a theme for generating static websites with [Jekyll]. You can write source files for your web pages using [Markdown], the [Liquid] templating language, and HTML.[^1] Jekyll builds your site by converting all files that have [front matter] to HTML. Your [Jekyll configuration] file determines which theme to use, and sets general parameters for your site, such as the URL of its home page.

Jekyll builds this Just the Docs theme docs website using the theme itself. These web pages show how your web pages will look *by default* when you use this theme. But you can easily *[customize]* the theme to make them look completely different!

Browse the docs to learn more about how to use this theme.

## Getting started

The [Just the Docs Template] provides the simplest, quickest, and easiest way to create a new website that uses the Just the Docs theme. To get started with creating a site, just click "[use the template]"!

{: .note }
To use the theme, you do ***not*** need to clone or fork the [Just the Docs repo]! You should do that only if you intend to browse the theme docs locally, contribute to the development of the theme, or develop a new theme based on Just the Docs.

You can easily set the site created by the template to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [template README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^2] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with the template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

{: .note }
See the theme [README][Just the Docs README] for how to use the theme as a gem without creating a new site.

### Source code usage and collaboration

{: .warning }

You should neither obtain this program from any other source nor should you distribute it or any portion thereof to any person, including people in the same research group.
It is expected that users of the programs will do so in collaboration with one of the principal authors. This serves to ensure both that the programs are used correctly and that the principal authors get adequate scientific credit for the time invested in developing the programs.

### Usual disclaimer

{: .note }

The authors make no claims about the correctness of the program suite and people who use it do so at their own risk.
